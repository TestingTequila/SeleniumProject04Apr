TDD: Test Driven Development
-JUnit & TestNG

  we no longer need main method to execute our code
  To run selective test cases
  To generate the report for tests executed
  To apply some pre & post conditions before or after executing your test case
  Don't wish to execute some test cases, from a bunch of test cases

  TestNG: 3a's
     -@annotations:  These are used to apply pre/post conditions over the test Cases represent using @Test annotations.
                     They are always used along with the methods

      @BeforeSuite   :This will be executed only once and that too before @BeforeTest
      @BeforeTest    :This will be executed only once and that too before @BeforeClass
      @BeforeClass   :This will be executed only once and that too before @BeforeMethod
      @BeforeMethod  :This will be executed before EVERY test case
      @Test          :This is used to represent your test case
      @AfterMethod   :This will be executed after EVERY test case
      @AfterClass    :This will be executed only once and that too after @AfterMethod
      @AfterTest     :This will be executed only once and that too after @AfterClass
      @AfterSuite    :This will be executed only once and that too after @AfterTest

      @DataProvider
      @Parameter

     -attributes  : These are used to gain more control over the already automated test cases
       priority
       enabled
       dependsOnMethods
       alwaysRun
       invocationCount
       groups
       dependsOnGroups
       timeOut

     -assertions  : These are used to validate the test Case/s
        AssertTrue
        AssertFalse
        AssertEquals
        AssertNotEquals
        HardAssertions Vs SoftAssertions
